				<h3>Method</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>Cook the pasta:</h4>
						<p>Bring a large pot of water (about 4 quarts) with a generous amount of salt to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until <i>al dente</i> following package instructions.</p>
						<p>As soon as you set the pot of water to boil, start the sauce. That way, the pasta will be cooked by the time the sauce is ready. You can then transfer the cooked pasta directly into the sauce without having to drain it.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Start the sauce:</h4>
						<p>Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the olive oil and once it's hot (rippling, but not smoking) add the guanciale. Cook until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the crispy guanciale into a small bowl and set it aside. There will be residual fat left in the pan. Don't discard it. Cook the onions in them.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Cook the onions:</h4>
						<p>Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the red pepper flakes and toast them for about 1 minute. Add the onions, salt, and black pepper. Cook until the onions are soft and translucent, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Add the wine:</h4>
						<p>Pull the pan off the heat and carefully add the white wine. Return the pan back to the stove top, increase the heat to high heat, and cook until the alcohol has burned off, about 5 minutes. The wine should be reduced by about three quarters.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Add the tomato:</h4>
						<p>Pour in the tomatoes and simmer over medium heat for 8 minutes until the raw tomato flavor cooks off and the sauce reduces just a tiny bit. Stir in the cooked guanciale. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Add the pasta:</h4>
						<p>Use tongs to add the cooked bucatini into the sauce and toss to evenly coat. Remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle in 1/4 cup Pecorino and toss to coat.</p>
						<p>Serve the pasta with parsley and more cheese sprinkled on top.</p>
						<p>Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Slowly reheat on the stove top over medium-low heat with a little bit of water, if necessary.</p>
